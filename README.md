## Introduction
The Arabic Sign Language (ARSL) Interpreter is designed to understand and translate sign language into spoken words, using a deep learning model trained on a comprehensive dataset of Arabic sign language gestures.

## Objectives
- To develop an efficient and accurate system for interpreting Arabic sign language.
- To create a user-friendly interface for real-time communication.
- To contribute to the inclusivity of the deaf and mute community in the digital age.

## Methodology
The project follows a structured approach, starting from data collection, preprocessing, model development, and testing, to deployment. The methodology section details each step involved in creating the ARSL interpreter.

### Data Collection
Details on the dataset used, including the number of signs, sources, and preprocessing techniques.

### Model Development
Information on the deep learning model architecture, training process, and tools used.

## Implementation
Steps taken to implement the ARSL interpreter, including software and hardware requirements, coding languages, and libraries.

## Results
A summary of the project's outcomes, accuracy rates, and user feedback.

## Future Work
Plans for enhancing the ARSL interpreter, including potential improvements and additional features.
